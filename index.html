  <h1>Hi, I'm Dinica</h1>
  <p>I'm a junior web developer passionate about building clean, modern, and 
    responsive websites. I started learning HTML and CSS a few months ago, and 
    now I'm diving into JavaScript and real project development. I enjoy
    solving problems, learning new technologies, and turning ideas into 
    real working websites. Right now, I'm focused on improving my skills 
    and building a portfolio that shows what I can do.</p>
